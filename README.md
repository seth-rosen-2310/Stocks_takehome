Simple Django app to extract structured information from investment documents.

The Django application does not work and I am aware of this, I ran out of time and had some issues getting parts of Django working since my experience is mostly with flask as well as some slowdowns due to OpenAI experiencing server connection issues for a good part of the afternoon. I included a jupyter notebook with an example output that shows how my approach works for the problem listed in the assignment writeup and given more time would have finished implementing a more scalable version using Django. I aimed to create functions that could be easily adapted later if needed but given the time I didn't do everything that I could think of. I also think that one key place that both speed and cost could be improved is in using traditional OCR instead of the vision model since the output from the vision model seems to vary widely for tasks that I know the GPT-4o models handle well when given text. If given more time the first thing I would do is finish implementing the Django app functionality such that it could be used for testing and development and secondly I would implement more rules and catches that would help increase reliablility and widen the range of possible inputs that I thought of during my time working on the assignment.
